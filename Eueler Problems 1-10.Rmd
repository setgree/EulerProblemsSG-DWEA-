## Euler Problem 1

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

```{r}

##if n is divisible 3 or 5, return n 
## if n is not divisible by 3 or 5, return 0.

# is there native language for "is divisible by" or should I create a rule about decimal places?

sumfun<-function(n){
 sum(1:n) 
  
  
}




```
