# EulerProblemsSG-DWEA-
Euler problems (https://projecteuler.net/) in R.

Someone smart recommended I go through a Euler problem a day if I am going to eventually transition into coding stuff. I will keep track of my progress here and you all are welcome to give it a go.

They are fun brain teasers for me, though I suspect Dan will want to start further in.
I think I know how to solve the first one manually but figuring out the if else part of the code is challenging.

My first instinct is to write out in theory what things should look like and then try to implement.
