# EulerProblemsSG-DWEA-
Euler problems (https://projecteuler.net/) in R.

2/19/2019 I know a lot more about coding now in terms of lingo and structure but my grasp of algorithms -- it's a different kind of problem-solving. I'm having a nice time working on it.

The phrase I was looking for above (in theory) was 'in pseudocode'

At this point this project is just for Seth but if that should change I'll update the documentation.
